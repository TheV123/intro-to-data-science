# Operations

## Assignment Operations

Assignment operations are used to assign values to variables

| Operation           | Symbol | Description                        |
|---------------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| Assignment          | `=`    | Assigns a value to a variable      |
| Add and Assign      | `+=`   | Adds and assigns the result        |
| Subtract and Assign | `-=`   | Subtracts and assigns the result   |
| Multiply and Assign | `*=`   | Multiplies and assigns the result  |
| Divide and Assign   | `/=`   | Divides and assigns the result     |
| Floor Divide and Assign | `//=` | Floor divides and assigns the result |
| Modulus and Assign  | `%=`   | Takes modulus and assigns the result |
| Exponentiate and Assign | `**=` | Raises to power and assigns the result |

## Comparison Operations

Comparison operations are used to compare two values

| Operation           | Symbol | Description                        |
|---------------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| Equal to            | `==`   | Checks if two values are equal     |
| Not equal to        | `!=`   | Checks if two values are not equal |
| Greater than        | `>`    | Checks if the left value is greater than the right |
| Less than           | `<`    | Checks if the left value is less than the right |
| Greater than or equal to | `>=` | Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right |
| Less than or equal to | `<=` | Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right |

## Logical Operations

Logical operations are used to combine conditional statements

| Operation           | Symbol | Description                        |
|---------------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| Logical AND         | `and`  | Returns True if both statements are true |
| Logical OR          | `or`   | Returns True if one of the statements is true |
| Logical NOT         | `not`  | Reverses the result, returns False if the result is true |

## Bitwise Operations

Bitwise operations are used to perform bit-level operations

| Operation           | Symbol | Description                        |
|---------------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| AND                 | `&`    | Performs bitwise AND               |
| OR                  | `|`    | Performs bitwise OR                |
| XOR                 | `^`    | Performs bitwise XOR               |
| NOT                 | `~`    | Performs bitwise NOT               |
| Left Shift          | `<<`   | Shifts bits to the left            |
| Right Shift         | `>>`   | Shifts bits to the right           |
