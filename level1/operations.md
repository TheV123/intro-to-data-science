# Operations

## Arithmetic Operations

Arithmetic operations are used to perform common mathematical calculations. Python supports several arithmetic operators:

| Operation     | Symbol | Description                        |
|---------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| Addition      | `+`    | Adds two operands                  |
| Subtraction   | `-`    | Subtracts the second operand from the first |
| Multiplication| `*`    | Multiplies two operands            |
| Division      | `/`    | Divides the first operand by the second (floating-point result) |
| Floor Division| `//`   | Divides the first operand by the second (integer result) |
| Modulus       | `%`    | Returns the remainder of the division |
| Exponentiation| `**`   | Raises the first operand to the power of the second |


## Assignment Operations

Assignment operations are used to assign values to variables

| Operation           | Symbol | Description                        |
|---------------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| Assignment          | `=`    | Assigns a value to a variable      |
| Add and Assign      | `+=`   | Adds and assigns the result        |
| Subtract and Assign | `-=`   | Subtracts and assigns the result   |
| Multiply and Assign | `*=`   | Multiplies and assigns the result  |
| Divide and Assign   | `/=`   | Divides and assigns the result     |

Other assignment operations such as `%=` exist is python but are not commonly used

## Comparison Operations

Comparison operations are used to compare two values

| Operation           | Symbol | Description                        |
|---------------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| Equal to            | `==`   | Checks if two values are equal     |
| Not equal to        | `!=`   | Checks if two values are not equal |
| Greater than        | `>`    | Checks if the left value is greater than the right |
| Less than           | `<`    | Checks if the left value is less than the right |
| Greater than or equal to | `>=` | Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right |
| Less than or equal to | `<=` | Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right |

## Logical Operations

Logical operations are used to combine conditional statements

| Operation           | Symbol | Description                        |
|---------------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| Logical AND         | `and`  | Returns `True` if both statements are true |
| Logical OR          | `or`   | Returns `True` if one of the statements is true |
| Logical NOT         | `not`  | Reverses the boolean value - returns `False` if the result is true or `True` if the result is false |

## Bitwise Operations

Bitwise operations are used to perform bit-level operations

| Operation           | Symbol | Description                        |
|---------------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| AND                 | `&`    | Performs bitwise AND               |
| OR                  | `|`    | Performs bitwise OR                |
| XOR                 | `^`    | Performs bitwise XOR               |
| NOT                 | `~`    | Performs bitwise NOT               |
| Left Shift          | `<<`   | Shifts bits to the left            |
| Right Shift         | `>>`   | Shifts bits to the right           |
